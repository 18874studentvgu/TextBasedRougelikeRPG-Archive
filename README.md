> Note: This is another archive of our project we did for one of the module in our university. It is not really suitable to be anything other than a proof of concept; nor does it represents the current coding practices of my collaborators and I. 

We attempted to create a text-based Rogue-like games, where a player continuously traverse down a dungeon, hitting enemies & looting chest. Due to time constraints as well as our inexperienced, the project never fully came to fruition. Only a CLI demo is ever playable.

> bellow is the original README.txt

```
A last-minute effort by 18874 & frinds:



To compile the project, cd into the src directory and then run the following command:
$ javac -d ../Classes TextUserInterface.java

or, alternatively, if "make" is installed, simply run:
$ make 

then, to run the Text-based demo, change directory in to the Classes folder:
$ cd ../Classes
$ java TextUserInterface

NOTE: I've only tested this on a Linux Terminal, Windows user might be met with unexpected behaviours
NOTE 2: sometimes you woould have to issue the command twice inorder to quit the game

```
