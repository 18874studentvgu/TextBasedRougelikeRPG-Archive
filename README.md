A last-minute effort by 18874 & frinds:



To compile the project, cd into the src directory and then run the following command:
$ javac -d ../Classes TextUserInterface.java

or, alternatively, if "make" is installed, simply run:
$ make 

then, to run the Text-based demo, change directory in to the Classes folder:
$ cd ../Classes
$ java TextUserInterface

NOTE: I've only tested this on a Linux Terminal, Windows user might be met with unexpected behaviours
NOTE 2: sometimes you woould have to issue the command twice inorder to quit the game

```
